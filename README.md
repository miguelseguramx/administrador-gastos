This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is the excercise realized as result of the seccion 10 of [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-de-principiante-a-experto-creando-mas-de-10-aplicaciones/)
but this time I add some things

-I add the option to add expenses and income once the budget is defined

The code of the class is in the commit with the tag of "course-version", the rest of them are features I add to practice my knowledge in react and improve my code as well as to create a more advanced and personalized version of the project

It's an expense manager

**The goal is that at some point my project is miles away from what I do in the course and the course has only given me the essence of the project**
